This file contains the function that takes in the title of a movie, and performs
a serach for related movies on Google.com. The results of this search are
scraped, their full titles retrieved from a scrape of IMDb.com if needed,
and returned.

Requires the json, requests, time, and BeautifulSoup python libraries in order
to execute the HTTP requests and properly scrape the response.

Also requires the lxml python library to efficiently parse the pages returned
from HTTP requests.
